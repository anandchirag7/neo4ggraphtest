[PIN MAP DETAILS]
This page describes the pin‑map scenario used for testing a wide‑board configuration that includes multiple devices and complex interconnections.

[DEMO WIDE BOARD SCENARIO]
Overview:
- The wide board scenario is designed to evaluate a range of operating conditions for various pin configurations.
- The board hosts several devices and interconnecting wires, creating a realistic test environment for power, analog, serial, and GPIO functions.

[PIN CONFIGURATION DETAILS]
The following table summarizes each device, its purpose, and the pin count involved.

[TABLE: DEVICE PIN SUMMARY]
| Device   | Function / Description                                   | Pin Count | Notes                                            |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Device 1 | VCC to GND – parallel power supply connection             | 4         | Provides a stable power rail for the whole system |
| Device 2 | DAC Input – connection to an external digital‑to‑analog converter | 3         | Converts digital data to analog voltage levels   |
| Device 3 | UART Communication – universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter | 2         | Enables serial data exchange between devices     |
| Device 4 | GPIO Configuration – general‑purpose I/O pins            | 6         | Programmable pins for custom functions           |

[RESULTS SUMMARY]
Key observations from the wide‑board tests:
- **Stable Power:** The VCC‑to‑GND arrangement delivers a reliable power supply across all devices.
- **Analog & Serial Performance:** DAC input and UART communication operate correctly over a variety of input signal frequencies.
