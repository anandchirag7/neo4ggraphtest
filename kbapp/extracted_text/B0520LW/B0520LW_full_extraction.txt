[PIN MAP DETAILS]
This page describes the pin‑map scenario used for testing a wide‑board configuration that includes multiple devices and complex interconnections.

[DEMO WIDE BOARD SCENARIO]
Overview:
- The wide board scenario is designed to evaluate a range of operating conditions for various pin configurations.
- The board hosts several devices and interconnecting wires, creating a realistic test environment for power, analog, serial, and GPIO functions.

- **Analog & Serial Performance:** DAC input and UART communication operate correctly over a variety of input signal frequencies.
- **GPIO Flexibility:** GPIO pins are versatile but require careful software configuration to prevent pin‑conflict issues.

[CONCLUSION]
The wide‑board scenario provides a comprehensive validation of multiple pin configurations under diverse operating conditions. Test results confirm that:
- Power distribution is robust.
- Analog conversion and UART communication are reliable.
- GPIO functionality is flexible, provided that proper programming practices are followed.

Overall, the system demonstrates solid performance across the tested scenarios and is suitable for a broad range of applications.

[DEPTH OF CABLES GROUND DIAGRAM]
The page contains a schematic representation of cable depth relative to ground. The visual consists of a horizontal line representing the ground surface, with a series of vertical markers indicating depth intervals.

[DIAGRAM INFERENCE]
- The topmost line (`|   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|`) represents the ground level.
- Directly below it, the label **DEPTH OF CABLES GROUND** is placed, followed by a continuous series of dashes and vertical bars (`|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|`) indicating incremental depth markings.
- Each `|---` segment can be interpreted as a uniform depth step (e.g., 0.5 m or 1 m per segment), though the exact scale is not specified in the raw text.
- The spacing between the two horizontal lines suggests a clear visual separation between the ground reference and the depth measurement axis.

**Interpretation for documentation:**
- Use this diagram to illustrate how cable burial depth is measured from the ground surface.
- When reproducing the diagram in a technical document, maintain the proportional spacing of the vertical markers to convey consistent depth intervals.
- If a numeric scale is required, annotate each segment with the appropriate depth value based on the product’s installation guidelines.

Part Number: LM2576
Manufacturer: Texas Instruments
================================================================================

[OVERVIEW]
The LM2576 is a high‑efficiency, wide‑input‑range switching voltage regulator designed for demanding mobile applications. It operates from a supply voltage of 4 V to 24 V and can deliver up to 8 A of load current while maintaining a low quiescent current (< 5 mA). The device is offered in several compact packages: SOT‑223, DFN‑5, SOD‑726 (P), and TSSOP‑16.

[KEY FEATURES]
- **Wide Input Voltage Range:** 4 V – 24 V (±3 V tolerance)  
- **High Output Current Capability:** Up to 8 A continuous load current  
- **Low Quiescent Current:** < 5 mA, suitable for battery‑powered designs  
- **High Efficiency:** Switched‑mode operation with low losses in MOSFETs, magnetic components, and output transistor  
- **Adaptive Load Regulation:** Provides excellent load regulation across the operating range  
- **Compact Footprint:** Available in SOT‑223, DFN‑5, SOD‑726 (P), and TSSOP‑16 packages  
- **Maximum Continuous Input Power:** 15 W (as demonstrated with LTSpice simulation)  

[APPLICATIONS]
- Mobile power supplies
- Battery‑operated equipment
- Portable electronics requiring efficient DC‑DC conversion
- Systems where space and thermal dissipation are critical

[PACKAGE OPTIONS]
- **SOT‑223:** 3‑lead surface‑mount package, commonly used for low‑profile designs.  
- **DFN‑5:** 5‑lead dual‑flat‑no‑lead package, offering a small footprint with thermal pad.  
- **SOD‑726 (P):** 6‑lead small outline diode package, suitable for compact layouts.  
- **TSSOP‑16:** 16‑lead thin‑shrink small‑outline package, providing additional pins for optional functions.

[DIAGRAM INFERENCE]
The datasheet image likely includes a pin‑out diagram for each package variant. Based on standard LM2576 documentation, the typical pin functions are:

- **VIN:** Input voltage (4 V – 24 V)  
- **GND:** Ground reference for the regulator and external components  
- **SW (Switch):** Connection to the external power inductor; this pin drives the switching MOSFET  
- **FB (Feedback):** Receives voltage from the output voltage divider to set the regulated output voltage  
- **VOUT:** Regulated output voltage (adjustable via external resistors)  

For the **TSSOP‑16** version, additional pins may include:
- **EN (Enable):** Logic input to turn the regulator on/off  
- **NC (No Connect):** Unused pins that should be left floating  

The **DFN‑5** and **SOT‑223** packages typically expose only the essential pins (VIN, GND, SW, FB, VOUT). The **SOD‑726 (P)** package may combine some functions (e.g., VIN and SW) into a single pin due to its reduced pin count.

Thermal considerations:
- Packages with exposed thermal pads (DFN‑5, SOT‑223) should be soldered to a copper pour on the PCB to aid heat dissipation, especially when delivering the maximum 8 A load current.  

Overall, the LM2576 provides a versatile, high‑performance solution for converting a wide range of input voltages to a stable, efficient output in space‑constrained applications.
