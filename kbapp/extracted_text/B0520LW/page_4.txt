[DEPTH OF CABLES GROUND DIAGRAM]
The page contains a schematic representation of cable depth relative to ground. The visual consists of a horizontal line representing the ground surface, with a series of vertical markers indicating depth intervals.

[DIAGRAM INFERENCE]
- The topmost line (`|   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|`) represents the ground level.
- Directly below it, the label **DEPTH OF CABLES GROUND** is placed, followed by a continuous series of dashes and vertical bars (`|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|`) indicating incremental depth markings.
- Each `|---` segment can be interpreted as a uniform depth step (e.g., 0.5 m or 1 m per segment), though the exact scale is not specified in the raw text.
- The spacing between the two horizontal lines suggests a clear visual separation between the ground reference and the depth measurement axis.

**Interpretation for documentation:**
- Use this diagram to illustrate how cable burial depth is measured from the ground surface.
- When reproducing the diagram in a technical document, maintain the proportional spacing of the vertical markers to convey consistent depth intervals.
- If a numeric scale is required, annotate each segment with the appropriate depth value based on the product’s installation guidelines.
