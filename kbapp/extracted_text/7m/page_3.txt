- Avoid use in areas where flammable gases are present.

[DIAGRAM INFERENCE]
The device’s pinout consists of eight equally spaced pins forming a circle around the central crystal. Visualizing the layout: imagine a clock face with pins at roughly the 12, 1:30, 3, 4:30, 6, 7:30, 9, and 10:30 o’clock positions. The pins are likely numbered sequentially around the circle, providing electrical connections to the crystal’s electrodes. The rectangular package encloses this circular pin arrangement, with the crystal positioned centrally within the 2 mm × 1 mm × 0.5 mm area.
