fSW
where fSW is the switching frequency in MHz.
When this pin is open or tied to VCC5V, the fSW is set to 100kHz. When this pin is tied to GND, 
the fSW is set to 550kHz. 
When an external clock signal is applied to this pin, the internal frequency is synchronized to the 
external clock frequency."
"6","PLL_COMP","PLL_COMP","Compensation pin for the internal PLL circuit. A compensation network shown in the “Typical 
Application Diagram” on page 2 is required. RPLL(2.7kΩ), CPLL1 (10nF), and CPLL2 (820pF) are 
recommended."
"7","CLKOUT/
DITHER","NC","Dual function pin. When a capacitor is not connected to this pin, it provides a clock signal to 
synchronize the other ISL81401. The phase shift of the clock signal is set by the FB_IN and 
IMON_IN pin voltages.
When a capacitor is connected to this pin, the clock out function is disabled and the frequency 
dither function is enabled before the soft-start. The capacitor is charged and discharged by 
internal current sources. As the voltage on the pin ramps up and down, the oscillator frequency 
is modulated between –15% and +15% of the nominal frequency set by the RT resistor. The 
frequency dither function is disabled in the external Sync mode or if the RT pin is open or 
shorted."
"8","SS/TRK","SS/TRK","Dual function pin. When used for soft-starting control, a soft-start capacitor is connected from 
this pin to ground. A regulated 2µA soft-starting current charges up the soft-start capacitor and 
ramps up the pin voltage. The pin voltage sets the reference of the output voltage control loop 
during soft-start. The value of the soft-start capacitor sets the output voltage ramp up slope.
When used for tracking control, an external supply rail is configured as the master and the 
output voltage of the master supply is applied to this pin using a resistor divider. The output 
voltage tracks the master supply voltage."
"9","COMP","COMP","Voltage error GM amplifier output. It sets the reference of the inner current loop. The feedback 
compensation network is connected between the COMP and SGND pins. When the COMP pin 
is pulled below 1V, the PWM duty cycle reduces to 0%."
"10","FB_OUT","FB_OUT","Output voltage feedback input. Connect FB_OUT to a resistive voltage divider between the 
output and SGND to adjust the output voltage. The FB_OUT pin voltage is regulated to the 
internal 0.8V reference."
"11","IMON_OUT","IMON_OUT","Output current monitor. The current from this pin is proportional to the differential voltage 
between the ISEN+ and ISEN- pins. Connect a resistor and capacitor network between the pin 
and SGND to make the pin voltage proportional to the average output current. When the pin 
voltage reaches 1.2V, the internal average current limit loop reduces the output voltage to keep 
the output current constant when constant current OCP mode is set or the converter shuts down 
when hiccup OCP mode is set.
In DEM Burst mode, when this pin voltage is less than 840mV, the controller runs in Burst mode. 
When this pin voltage is higher than 880mV, the controller exits Burst mode. When a higher 
resistance on this pin is used to set its voltage higher than 880mV at no load condition, the 
controller runs in DEM mode with no burst operation."

"15","PGOOD","PGOOD","Open-drain logic output used to indicate the status of output voltage. This pin is pulled low when 
the output is not within ±10% of the nominal voltage or the EN pin is pulled low."

MOSFET’s source, filter inductor, and lower MOSFET’s drain of the boost converter."
