"18","BOOT2","BOOT2","Bootstrap pin to provide bias for the boost high-side driver. The positive terminal of the 
bootstrap capacitor connects to this pin. Connect a bootstrap diode between this pin and VDD 
to create the bias for the high-side driver. The BOOT2 to PHASE2 voltage is monitored 
internally. When the voltage drops to 3.9V at no switching condition, a minimum off-time pulse is 
issued to turn off UG2 and turn on LG2 to refresh the bootstrap capacitor and maintain the 
high-side driver bias voltage."
"19","LG2/
OC_MODE","LG2/
OC_MODE","Low-side MOSFET gate driver output controlled by the boost PWM signal and OCP mode set 
pin. The OCP mode is set by a resistor connected between the pin and ground during the 
initiation stage before soft-start. During the initiation stage, the pin sources out 10µA current to 
set the voltage on the pin. If the pin voltage is less than 0.3V, the OCP is set to constant current 
mode. If the pin voltage is higher than 0.3V, the OCP is set to Hiccup mode."
"20","VDD","VDD","Output of the internal 5.3V linear regulator supplied by either VIN or EXTBIAS. This output 
supplies bias for the IC low-side drivers and the boot circuitries for the high-side drivers. The 
VDD pin must always be decoupled to the PGND pin with a minimum 4.7µF ceramic capacitor 
placed very close to the pin."
"21","PGND","PGND","Power ground connection. This pin should be connected to the sources of the lower MOSFETs 
and the (-) terminals of the VDD decoupling capacitors."
"22","LG1","LG1","Low-side MOSFET gate driver output controlled by the PWM Buck signal."
"23","BOOT1","BOOT1","Bootstrap pin to provide bias for the buck high-side driver. The positive terminal of the bootstrap 
capacitor connects to this pin. Connect a bootstrap diode between this pin and VDD to create 
the bias for the high-side driver. The BOOT1 to PHASE1 voltage is monitored internally. When 
the voltage drops to 3.9V at no switching condition, a minimum off-time pulse is issued to turn 
off UG1 and turn on LG1 to refresh the bootstrap capacitor and maintain the high-side driver 
bias voltage."
"24","PHASE1","PHASE1","Phase node connection of the buck converter. This pin is connected to the junction of the upper 
MOSFET’s source, filter inductor, and lower MOSFET’s drain of the buck converter."
"25","UG1","UG1","High-side MOSFET gate driver output controlled by the buck PWM signal."
"26","EXTBIAS","EXTBIAS","External bias input for the optional VDD LDO. There is an internal switch to disconnect the VIN 
LDO when EXTBIAS voltage is higher than typical 4.8V. Decouple this pin to ground with a 
10µF ceramic capacitor when it is in use, otherwise tie this pin to ground. DO NOT float this pin."
"27","VIN","VIN","Tie this pin to the input rail using a 5Ω to 10Ω resistor. It provides power to the internal LDO for 
VDD. Decouple this pin with a small ceramic capacitor (10nF to 1µF) to ground."
"28","CS+","CS+","Input current sense signal positive input pin."
"29","CS-","CS-","Input current sense signal negative input pin."
"30","EN/
UVLO","EN/
UVLO","This pin provides enable/disable and accurate UVLO functions. The output is disabled when the 
pin is pulled to ground. When the voltage on the pin reaches 1.3V, the VDD and VCC5V LDOs 
become active. When the voltage on the pin reaches 1.8V, the PWM modulator is enabled. 
When the pin is floating, it is enabled in default by internal pull-up."
"31","IMON_IN","IMON_IN","Input current monitor. The current from this pin is proportional to the differential voltage between 
the CS+ and CS- pins. Connect a resistor and capacitor network between the pin and SGND to 
make the pin voltage proportional to the average input current. When the pin voltage reaches 
1.2V, the internal average current limit loop reduces the output voltage to keep the input current 
constant when constant current OCP mode is set or the converter shuts down when hiccup 
OCP mode is set.
When the input current monitor function is not used, tie this pin to VCC5V or SGND to set up the 
phase shift for interleaving parallel operation."
"32","NC","NC","No connection pin."

EPAD","SGND
EPAD","Small-signal ground common to all control circuitry. Route this pin separately from the high 
current ground (PGND). SGND and PGND can be tied together if there is one solid ground 
plane with no noisy currents around the chip. All voltage levels are measured with respect to this 
pin. 
EPAD at ground potential. EPAD is connected to SGND internally. However, it is highly 
recommended to solder it directly to the ground plane for better thermal performance and noise 
immunity."
