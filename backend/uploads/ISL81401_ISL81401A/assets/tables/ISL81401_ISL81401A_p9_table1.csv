Number","Pin Name

"1","NC","NC","No connection pin."
"2","FB_IN","NC","Input voltage feedback pin for reverse direction operation. Use a resistor divider to feed the 
input voltage back to this pin. When the input voltage drops to the pin voltage below 0.8V, the 
internal control loop reduces the duty cycle to sink in current from output to input to keep the pin 
voltage regulated at 0.8V.
Keep the pin voltage below 0.3V to disable the reverse direction operation.
When the reverse operation function is not used, tie this pin to VCC5V or SGND to set up the 
phase shift for the interleaving parallel operation."
"3","VCC5V","VCC5V","Output of the internal 5V linear regulator. This output supplies bias for the IC. The VCC5V pin 
must always be decoupled to SGND with a minimum of 4.7µF ceramic capacitor placed very 
close to the pin."
"4","NC","NC","No connection pin."
