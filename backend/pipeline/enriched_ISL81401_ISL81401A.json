The ISL81401 is a \nbidirectional device that can conduct current in both \ndirections while the ISL81401A is an unidirectional \ndevice. \nThe ISL81401 and ISL81401A use the proprietary \nbuck-boost control algorithm with valley current \nmodulation for Boost mode and peak current modulation \nfor Buck mode control. \nThe ISL81401 and ISL81401A have four independent \ncontrol loops for input and output voltages and currents. \nInherent peak current sensing at both ends and \ncycle-by-cycle current limit of this family of products \nensures high operational reliability by providing instant \ncurrent limit in fast transient conditions at either ends and \nin both directions. It also has two current monitoring pins \nat both input and output to facilitate Constant Current \n(CC) limit and other system management functions.

The block diagram (Fig. 5) shows the following key sections:\n\n| Section | Primary Function |\n|---------|------------------|\n| **Input‑Stage** | VIN enters the device; over‑voltage protection (OVP) and under‑voltage lock‑out (UVLO) monitor the supply. |\n| **Bias & Reference** | Dedicated LDOs generate clean VDD, VCC5V, and 0.8 V reference rails. An internal reference (REF) feeds the slope‑compensation ramp and comparator thresholds. |\n| **Control Logic** | Buck‑Boost Logic and PWM Logic generate the switching signals. A PLL/Clock generator provides the timing base (CLKOUT) and can be synchronized (SYNC) to an external clock. Adaptive dead‑time and boot‑refresh circuits (BOOT1/BOOT2) optimise switching transitions. |\n| **PWM & Phase Generation** | Two independent phases (PHASE1/PHASE2) each contain a PWM comparator, gate drivers (UG1/UG2), high‑side (HG) and low‑side (LG) drivers, and adaptive dead‑time. The phases share a common ramp generator and slope‑compensation network. |\n| **Current Sensing & Protection** | Dual sense amplifiers (ISEN+, ISEN–) feed pulse‑by‑pulse peak‑current limit circuits for both buck and boost modes. Negative‑peak current limit and fault latch circuitry protect against overloads and shorts. |\n| **Feedback & Regulation** | FB_IN receives the external voltage divider feedback; FB_OUT delivers the regulated voltage to the load (VOUT). A programmable gain (GM1‑GM4) network, together with the slope‑comp ramp, sets the compensation for stable operation across the entire input‑output range. |\n| **Output & Monitoring** | VOUT is the regulated output. IMON_OUT and IMON_IN provide current‑monitoring ports for external diagnostics. The device also includes a “DEM Burst” logic for intermittent‑burst operation. |\n| **Power‑Good & Enable** | PGOOD indicates a valid output, while EN/UVLO controls the active state. POR (Power‑On Reset) and enable pins manage start‑up sequencing. |\n| **External Interface** | EPAD (exposed pad) and SGND (system ground) complete the layout for thermal and noise performance. |\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n- **Dual‑phase architecture** enables high current capability with interleaved operation for reduced ripple.  \n- **Integrated LDOs, reference, and bias circuits** simplify board design and improve noise performance.  \n- **Adaptive dead‑time and boot‑refresh** enhance efficiency across buck and boost modes.  \n- **Pulse‑by‑pulse current limiting** provides fast overload protection for both buck and boost phases.  \n- **Programmable gain and slope‑compensation** allow the regulator to be tuned for a wide range of input voltages (down‑ to 0.8 V) and output loads.  \n\nOverall, the ISL81401/ISL81401A combines all essential buck‑boost functions—switching, regulation, protection, and monitoring—in a single, compact IC suitable for high‑performance power‑management applications.",

Practical Implications**  \n- **ISL81401** is suited for designs needing bidirectional current flow, optional parallel operation, and dithering for EMI reduction.  \n- **ISL81401A** removes the ability to parallel devices and eliminates dithering, but adds feedback‑input (FB_IN) and clock‑output (CLKOUT) pins, making it more appropriate for fixed‑direction, tightly controlled regulation.  \n- **ISL81601** offers a higher input‑voltage envelope (60–70 V) and higher VDD (8 V) while retaining bidirectional and parallel capabilities; it does not have the pin removals present in the 81401 series.  \n\n**5.

Some pins are “NC” (no connection) on either version. |\n\n**General Layout Notes**\n\n- The device is a dual‑phase, interleaved buck regulator (ISL81401/01A) optimized for high‑efficiency, high‑current applications.\n- Pin 2 (FB_IN) is the only pin whose function differs between the two part numbers; on the “A” version it is internally disconnected, while on the base part it provides reverse‑direction feedback.\n- All power‑supply pins (VCC5V, VDD, SGND) require proper decoupling according to the datasheet, especially VCC5V (≥ 4.7 µF close to the pin) to maintain stable internal regulation.\n- Pins related to interleaving and phase control (**PHASE1**, **PHASE2**, **RT/SYNC**) must be routed per the recommended schematic to achieve the intended phase‑shifted operation.\n- The **BOOT** pins work with external bootstrap capacitors to drive the high‑side MOSFETs; ensure correct capacitor values and placement for reliable switching.\n- **EN/UVLO**, **COMP**, and **PLL_COMP** provide under‑voltage lock‑out and compensation tuning; typical values are given in the full datasheet.\n- **PGOOD**, **LG1**, **LG2/OC_MODE**, and **IMON_OUT** give status and fault reporting; connect to the host controller or LED indicators as required.\n\n**Usage Recommendations**\n\n1. **Decoupling:** Place a ≥ 4.7 µF ceramic capacitor directly on VCC5V; additional 0.1 µF per supply pin is advised.\n2. **Reverse‑Direction Operation:** If you need the regulator to sink current from output to input, correctly size the resistor divider feeding FB_IN and keep the pin voltage ≤ 0.8 V. Otherwise, tie FB_IN to VCC5V or SGND.\n3. **Phase‑Shift Configuration:** For interleaved parallel operation, tie FB_IN as noted and route RT/SYNC, PHASE1, PHASE2 per the reference layout to achieve the desired 180° phase shift.\n4. **Bootstrap Network:** Use low‑ESR ceramic capacitors on BOOT1/BOOT2 as specified; keep trace lengths short to minimize ringing.\n5. **Protection & Monitoring:** Connect LG1/LG2 to over‑current detection circuitry, and use PGOOD, IMON_OUT, and CS signals for monitoring and fault handling in the host system. \n\n*All other pins not listed above are either “NC” (no connection) or have device‑specific functions detailed in the full ISL81401/01A datasheet.*",

Pulling COMP < 1 V forces PWM duty to 0 %. |\n| 10 | **FB_OUT** | Output‑voltage feedback node. | Connect to a resistor divider from the regulated output to SGND; controller regulates this node to an internal 0.8 V reference. |\n| 11 | **IMON_OUT** | Average output‑current monitor. | Voltage proportional to the differential voltage across ISEN+ / ISEN‑ (set by external RC). <br>• ≥ 1.2 V triggers the internal average‑current‑limit loop (OCP). <br>• In DEM‑Burst mode: < 0.84 V → enter burst; > 0.88 V → exit burst. Using a higher‑value resistor to raise the no‑load voltage > 0.88 V forces DEM without burst. |\n| 12 | **MODE** | Selects CCM vs. DEM operation. | Low or floating → forces Continuous‑Conduction‑Mode (CCM). High → permits Discontinuous‑Conduction‑Mode (DEM). |\n| 13‑14 | **ISEN‑ / ISEN+** | Differential current‑sense inputs. | Connect across the sense resistor; the voltage difference is amplified for current‑limit and monitoring functions. |\n| 15 | **PGOOD** | Open‑drain status indicator. | Pulled low when output voltage deviates > ±10 % of nominal or when EN is low. |\n| 16 | **UG2** | High‑side MOSFET gate driver output. | Driven by the boost PWM waveform. |\n| 17 | **PHAS** | (Pin description omitted in the excerpt.) |\n\n**Overall Operation Highlights**\n\n* **Frequency Control** – RT pin selects a default switching frequency (100 kHz‑600 kHz) or synchronises to an external clock.  \n* **PLL Compensation** – PLL_COMP required for stable PLL operation; recommended external components are given.  \n* **Clock/Dither Flexibility** – CLKOUT can provide a synchronization clock or, when loaded with a capacitor, generate a pre‑soft‑start frequency dither (±15 % swing).  \n* **Soft‑Start vs. Tracking** – SS/TRK pin can be used for a regulated 2 µA soft‑start ramp or for voltage‑tracking a master supply.  \n* **Current Sensing & OCP** – ISEN pair feeds the internal current‑limit loop; IMON_OUT reports average current and controls OCP modes (constant‑current or hiccup) and DEM‑burst behavior.  \n* **Mode Selection** – MODE pin decides between forced CCM (low/floating) or optional DEM (high).  \n* **Voltage Regulation** – COMP and FB_OUT form the inner current‑loop and outer voltage‑loop respectively; pulling COMP low shuts the PWM off.  \n* **Protection and Status** – PGOOD indicates out‑of‑range output voltage; UG2 drives the high‑side MOSFET; PHAS function not detailed in the provided text.  \n\nThese pin functions together enable the ISL81401 to operate as a versatile, programmable boost regulator with selectable switching frequency, soft‑start, voltage tracking, current limiting, and both CCM and DEM modes.",

The default switching frequency of the PWM controller is determined by the resistor RT \nas shown in Equation 1.\nwhere fSW is the switching frequency in MHz.\nWhen this pin is open or tied to VCC5V, the fSW is set to 100kHz. When this pin is tied to GND, \nthe fSW is set to 550kHz. \nWhen an external clock signal is applied to this pin, the internal frequency is synchronized to the \nexternal clock frequency.\n6\nPLL_COMP\nPLL_COMP\nCompensation pin for the internal PLL circuit. A compensation network shown in the “Typical \nApplication Diagram” on page 2 is required. RPLL(2.7kΩ), CPLL1 (10nF), and CPLL2 (820pF) are \nrecommended.\n7\nCLKOUT/\nDITHER\nNC\nDual function pin. When a capacitor is not connected to this pin, it provides a clock signal to \nsynchronize the other ISL81401. The phase shift of the clock signal is set by the FB_IN and \nIMON_IN pin voltages.\nWhen a capacitor is connected to this pin, the clock out function is disabled and the frequency \ndither function is enabled before the soft-start. The capacitor is charged and discharged by \ninternal current sources. As the voltage on the pin ramps up and down, the oscillator frequency \nis modulated between –15% and +15% of the nominal frequency set by the RT resistor. The \nfrequency dither function is disabled in the external Sync mode or if the RT pin is open or \nshorted.\n8\nSS/TRK\nSS/TRK\nDual function pin. When used for soft-starting control, a soft-start capacitor is connected from \nthis pin to ground. A regulated 2µA soft-starting current charges up the soft-start capacitor and \nramps up the pin voltage. The pin voltage sets the reference of the output voltage control loop \nduring soft-start. The value of the soft-start capacitor sets the output voltage ramp up slope.\nWhen used for tracking control, an external supply rail is configured as the master and the \noutput voltage of the master supply is applied to this pin using a resistor divider. The output \nvoltage tracks the master supply voltage.\n9\nCOMP\nCOMP\nVoltage error GM amplifier output. It sets the reference of the inner current loop. The feedback \ncompensation network is connected between the COMP and SGND pins. When the COMP pin \nis pulled below 1V, the PWM duty cycle reduces to 0%.\n10\nFB_OUT\nFB_OUT\nOutput voltage feedback input. Connect FB_OUT to a resistive voltage divider between the \noutput and SGND to adjust the output voltage. The FB_OUT pin voltage is regulated to the \ninternal 0.8V reference.\n11\nIMON_OUT\nIMON_OUT\nOutput current monitor. The current from this pin is proportional to the differential voltage \nbetween the ISEN+ and ISEN- pins. Connect a resistor and capacitor network between the pin \nand SGND to make the pin voltage proportional to the average output current. When the pin \nvoltage reaches 1.2V, the internal average current limit loop reduces the output voltage to keep \nthe output current constant when constant current OCP mode is set or the converter shuts down \nwhen hiccup OCP mode is set.\nIn DEM Burst mode, when this pin voltage is less than 840mV, the controller runs in Burst mode. \nWhen this pin voltage is higher than 880mV, the controller exits Burst mode. When a higher \nresistance on this pin is used to set its voltage higher than 880mV at no load condition, the \ncontroller runs in DEM mode with no burst operation.\n12\nMODE\nMODE\nInput pin.

Internal monitor forces refresh when BOOT1‑PHASE1 < 3.9 V. |\n| **PHASE1** | Buck‑converter phase node (top MOSFET source / inductor / bottom MOSFET drain) | External connection for the power‑stage. |\n| **UG1** | High‑side buck MOSFET driver | Driven by the buck PWM signal. |\n| **EXTBIAS** | Optional external bias for VDD LDO | If used, decouple with 10 µF to ground; otherwise tie to ground. Do NOT leave floating. |\n| **VIN** | Input to internal LDO that generates VDD | Tie to input rail through 5‑10 Ω, decouple with 10 nF–1 µF to ground. |\n| **CS+ / CS‑** | Differential current‑sense inputs | Form the voltage to be sensed by **IMON_IN**. |\n| **EN / UVLO** | Enable & under‑voltage lock‑out control | • 0 V → converter disabled. <br>• 1.3 V → LDOs turn on. <br>• 1.8 V → PWM modulator enabled. <br>Floating = enabled (internal pull‑up). |\n| **IMON_IN** | Input‑current monitor output | Voltage proportional to average input current (set by resistor‑capacitor network to SGND). ≥ 1.2 V triggers the internal average‑current limit: reduces output voltage in constant‑current OCP mode or shuts down in hiccup OCP mode. If unused, tie to VCC5V or SGND. |\n\n**General notes**  \n- Bootstrap capacitors must be paired with diodes to VDD for both boost and buck high‑side drivers.  \n- All decoupling capacitors should be placed as close as possible to the associated pins.  \n- Proper resistor values on **OC_MODE** and **VIN** set OCP behavior and LDO input impedance, respectively.  \n\nThis concise table captures the essential functions and hardware‑connection requirements for each pin of the ISL81401/01A dual‑converter controller."

The bootstrap capacitor’s positive terminal connects here; a diode to VDD creates the bias.

Its behavior is set by the over‑current‑protection (OCP) mode pin during the initiation stage: a resistor to ground and a 10 µA source current establish the pin voltage. < 0.3 V → constant‑current OCP; ≥ 0.3 V → hiccup‑mode OCP. |\n| **20 – VDD** | 5.3 V output of the internal linear regulator (powered from VIN or EXTBIAS).

Its switching frequency can be set from ~90 kHz to ~650 kHz by selecting the RT resistor or pulling RT low/high. Synchronization accepts 140 kHz–600 kHz inputs, and a clock output tracks the switching frequency. Dither and diode‑emulation modes are configurable via low‑level voltage thresholds and µA‑scale currents. Burst mode is triggered by IMON_OUT voltage windows (≈ 0.82 V‑0.89 V). The device operates across a wide VIN range (4.5–40 V) and temperature span (‑40 °C to +125 °C).",

Graphs are given for three ambient temperatures: –40 °C, +25 °C, and +125 °C. |\n\nOverall, the controller maintains a stable switching frequency, tight reference voltage tolerance, and predictable soft‑start behavior across a wide temperature range and input‑voltage span. The input‑current monitor (IMON_IN) provides accurate current sensing with a 3 mΩ sense resistor and 37.4 kΩ scaling resistor."

The gradual slope confirms that the internal soft‑start circuitry limits in‑rush voltage and current, preventing overshoot and stress on the input source."

              "answer": "Figure 40 captures bi‑directional operation: with VIN removed, the converter continues to supply power to the load by drawing energy from the output capacitors and feeding it back to the input pins, effectively acting as a boost. The VOUT stays near 6 V (the regulation point) and the input pin voltage rises, confirming that the ISL81401 can operate as a buck‑boost and support reverse power flow, a key feature for applications like battery‑back‑up or regenerative systems."

Output voltage (VOUT)  \n  2. Average output current (IOUT) – for constant‑current operation  \n  3. Input current (IIN) – for reverse‑direction control  \n  4. Input voltage (VIN) – for UVP/UVLO functions  \n- An independent Enable/Disable pin provides flexible power‑up sequencing and a simple VIN‑under‑voltage‑protect (UVP) implementation.  \n- Soft‑start duration is programmable by the external soft‑start capacitor connected to the SS/TRK pin.\n\n**5.2 Internal LDOs and External Bias (EXTBIAS)**  \n- The device has two input pins: **VIN** and **EXTBIAS**, and three internal low‑dropout regulators (LDOs):  \n  - Two 5.3 V LDOs generate **VDD**, which powers the MOSFET gate‑driver blocks.  \n  - A third LDO generates **VCC5V** (5 V) from VDD; VCC5V powers all other internal circuitry.  \n- Recommended bypassing: 10 µF on VDD (to power‑ground) and 10 µF on VCC5V (to signal ground).  \n- **Power‑on‑reset (POR)** monitors VCC5V; if VCC5V falls below 3.5 V, all regulators are shut down.  \n- Each VDD LDO can source > 75 mA, sufficient for the gate drivers. The VCC5V LDO can also supply > 75 mA to internal logic, but the total external load current drawn from VDD is limited by the gate‑driver current demand (e.g., a 15 nC MOSFET at 300 kHz needs ~4.5 mA).  \n- At high input voltage or when large MOSFETs are used, the internal 5.3 V LDO may dissipate significant power, risking thermal overload (> +150 °C).  \n- **EXTBIAS** provides an external 5 V bias to off‑load the internal LDO and reduce dissipation:  \n  - When EXTBIAS > ~4.8 V, the EXTBIAS‑to‑VDD LDO becomes active and the VIN‑to‑VDD LDO disconnects.  \n  - EXTBIAS maximum rating = 36 V.  \n  - For VOUT ≪ VIN, EXTBIAS is typically back‑biased by VOUT to minimise loss.  \n  - EXTBIAS may only turn on after soft‑start completes; an external UVLO circuit can be added to guarantee smooth start‑up.  \n  - Recommended: 10 µF capacitor on EXTBIAS and a diode to VOUT to prevent the pin from being pulled low during a VOUT short.  \n- Over‑current protection on the VDD LDOs: VIN‑to‑VDD limit ≈ 120 mA (typ.), EXTBIAS‑to‑VDD limit ≈ 160 mA (typ.).\n\n**5.3 Enable (EN/UVLO) and Soft‑Start Operation**  \n- The EN/UVLO pin controls device power‑up/down: a voltage > 1.3 V enables the three LDOs and starts the controller.  \n- Once VCC5V reaches its POR threshold, the controller becomes fully powered.  \n- Soft‑start timing is set by the external capacitor on the SS/TRK pin, allowing the designer to limit in‑rush current and control the VOUT rise‑time.  \n\n**Key Takeaways**  \n- ISL81401/ISL81401A integrate buck‑boost control, driver, protections, and monitoring in a single current‑mode IC.  \n- Automatic buck/boost mode selection maintains regulated VOUT across a wide VIN range and load dynamics.  \n- Three internal LDOs (two 5.3 V for gate drivers, one 5 V for logic) simplify power budgeting, but designers must manage their current capability and dissipation.  \n- EXTBIAS optionally supplies the gate‑driver bias externally to reduce internal LDO loss, especially for high‑voltage or high‑current MOSFETs.  \n- Enable/UVLO and programmable soft‑start provide robust power‑up sequencing and in‑rush control.  \n\nThis summary captures the core functional features, internal power architecture, and critical design considerations for using the ISL81401/ISL81401A buck‑boost controllers.",

Functional Description\n5.\nFunctional Description\n5.1\nGeneral Description\nThe ISL81401 and ISL81401A implement a complete buck-boost switching control with a PWM controller, \ninternal drivers, references, protection circuitry, current and voltage control inputs, and monitor outputs. Refer to \nFigure 5 on page 6. \nThe ISL81401 and ISL81401A are current-mode controllers. They use a proprietary control algorithm to \nautomatically switch between Buck and Boost modes as necessary to maintain a steady output voltage with \nchanging input voltages and dynamic external loads. The controllers integrate four control loops to regulate not \nonly VOUT, but also average IOUT and IIN for constant current control and VIN for reverse direction control.\nThe driver and protection circuits are also integrated to simplify the end design.\nThe part has an independent enable/disable control line, which provides a flexible power-up sequencing and a \nsimple VIN UVP implementation. The soft-start time is programmable by adjusting the soft-start capacitor \nconnected from SS/TRK.\n5.2\nInternal 5.3V Linear Regulator (VDD), External Bias Supply (EXTBIAS), and \n5V Linear Regulator (VCC5V)\nThe ISL81401 and ISL81401A provide two input pins, VIN and EXTBIAS, and two internal LDOs for VDD gate \ndriver supply. A third LDO generates VCC5V from VDD. VCC5V provides power to all internal functional \ncircuits other than the gate drivers. Bypass the linear regulator’s outputs (VDD) with a 10µF capacitor to the power \nground. Also bypass the third linear regulator output (VCC5V) with a 10µF capacitor to the signal ground. VCC5V \nis monitored by a power-on-reset circuit, which disables all regulators when VCC5V falls below 3.5V.\nBoth LDOs from VIN and EXTBIAS can source over 75mA for VDD to power the buck and boost gate drivers. \nWhen driving large FETs at high switching frequency, little or no regulator current may be available for external \nloads. The LDO from VDD to VCC5V can also source over 75mA to supply the IC internal circuit. Although the \ncurrent consumed by the internal circuit is low, the current supplied by VCC5V to the external loads is limited by \nVDD. For example, a single large FET with 15nC total gate charge requires 15nC x 300kHz = 4.5mA \n(15nC x 600kHz = 9mA). \nAlso, at higher input voltages with larger FETs, the power dissipation across the internal 5.3V LDO increases. \nExcessive power dissipation across this regulator must be avoided to prevent junction temperature rise. Thermal \nprotection may be triggered if die temperature increases above +150°C due to excessive power dissipation. \nWhen large MOSFETs are used, an external 5V bias voltage can be applied to the EXTBIAS pin to alleviate \nexcessive power dissipation. When the voltage at the EXTBIAS pin is higher than typical 4.8V, the LDO from \nEXTBIAS activates and the LDO from VIN is disconnected. The recommended maximum voltage at the \nEXTBIAS pin is 36V. For applications with VOUT significantly lower than VIN, EXTBIAS is usually back biased \nby VOUT to reduce the LDO power loss. EXTBIAS is allowed to activate only after soft-start is finished to avoid \nearly activation during the VOUT rising stage. An external UVLO circuit might be necessary to ensure smooth \nsoft-starting. Renesas recommends adding a 10µF capacitor on the EXTBIAS pin and using a diode to connect the \nEXTBIAS pin to VOUT to avoid the EXTBIAS pin voltage being pulled low at the VOUT short-circuit condition.\nThe two VDD LDOs have an overcurrent limit for short-circuit protection. The VIN to VDD LDO current limit is \nset to typical 120mA. The EXTBIAS to VDD LDO current limit is set to typical 160mA.\n5.3\nEnable (EN/UVLO) and Soft-Start Operation\nPulling the EN/UVLO pin high or low can enable or disable the controller. When the EN/UVLO pin voltage is \nhigher than 1.3V, the three LDOs are enabled. After the VCC5V reaches the POR threshold, the controller is \npowered up to initialize its internal circuit. When EN/UVLO is higher than the 1.8V accurate UVLO threshold, the \nISL81401 and ISL81401A soft-start circuitry becomes active. The internal 2µA charge current begins charging up \nthe soft-start capacitor connected from the SS/TRK pin to GND. The voltage error amplifier reference voltage is \n",

To implement tracking, connect a resistive divider \nbetween the external supply output and ground. Connect the center point of the divider to the SS/TRK pin of the \nISL81401 and ISL81401A. The resistive divider ratio sets the ramping ratio between the two voltage rails. To \nimplement coincident tracking, set the tracking resistive divider ratio exactly the same as the ISL81401 and \nISL81401A output resistive divider given by Equation 5 on page 27. Make sure that the voltage at SS/TRK is \ngreater than 0.8V when the master rail reaches regulation.\nTo minimize the impact of the 2µA soft-start current on the tracking function, Renesas recommends using resistors \nless than 10kΩ for the tracking resistive divider.\nWhen the SS/TRK pin voltage is pulled down to less than 0.3V by the external tracking source, the prebias startup \nDEM function is enabled again. The output voltage may not be able to be pull down if the load current is not \nhighenough.\nWhen Overcurrent Protection (OCP) is triggered, the internal minimum soft-start circuit determines the 50ms OCP \nsoft-start hiccup off-time.\n5.5\nControl Loops\nThe ISL81401 and ISL81401A are current-mode controllers that can provide an output voltage above, equal to, or \nbelow the input voltage. Referring to Figure 2 on page 2 (Typical Application circuit) and Figure 5 on page 6 \n(Block Diagram), the Renesas proprietary control architecture uses a current sense resistor in series with the buck \nupper FET to sense the inductor current in Buck or Boost mode. The inductor current is controlled by the voltage \non the COMP pin, which is the lowest output of the error amplifiers Gm1 - Gm4. As the simplest example, when \nthe output is regulated to a constant voltage, the FB_OUT pin receives the output feedback signal, which is \ncompared to the internal reference by Gm1. Lower output voltage creates higher COMP voltage, which leads to \nhigher PWM duty cycle to push more current to the output. Conversely, higher output voltage creates lower COMP \nvoltage, which leads to lower PWM duty cycle to reduce the current to the output.\nThe ISL81401 and ISL81401A have four error amplifiers (Gm1-4) which can control output voltage (Gm1), input \nvoltage (Gm2), input current (Gm3), and output current (Gm4). In a typical application, the output voltage is \nregulated by Gm1, and the remaining error amplifiers are monitoring for excessive input or output current or an \ninput undervoltage condition. In other applications, such as a battery charger, the output current regulator (Gm4) \nimplements constant current charging until a predetermined voltage is reached, at which point the output voltage \nregulator (Gm1) takes control.\n5.5.1\nOutput Voltage Regulation Loop\nThe ISL81401 and ISL81401A provide a precision 0.8V internal reference voltage to set the output voltage. \nBased on this internal reference, the output voltage can be set from 0.8V up to a level determined by the \nfeedback voltage divider, as shown in Figure 42 on page 28.\nA resistive divider from the output to ground sets the output voltage. Connect the center point of the divider to \nthe FB_OUT pin. The output voltage value is determined by Equation 5.\nwhere RFBO1 is the top resistor of the feedback divider network and RFBO2 is the bottom resistor connected \nfrom FB_OUT to ground, shown in Figure 42.\nVOUT\n0.8V\nRFBO1\nRFBO2\n+\nRFBO2\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n(EQ. 5)\n",

The loop stability can be affected by many different \nfactors such as VIN, VOUT, load current, switching frequency, inductor value, output capacitance, and the \ncompensation network on COMP pin.

CCOMP2 is typically \n1/10th to 1/30th of CCOMP1 to filter high frequency noise. A good starting value for RCOMP is 10k. Lower RCOMP \nimproves stability but slows the loop response. Optimize the final compensation network with a bench test.\n5.5.2\nInput Voltage Regulation Loop\nAs shown in Figure 43, the input voltage VIN can be sensed by the FB_IN pin using a resistor divider \nRFBIN1/RFBIN2 and regulated by Gm2. When the FB_IN pin voltage falls below the 0.8V reference voltage, the \nCOMP pin voltage is pulled low to reduce the PWM duty cycle and the input current. For applications with a \nhigh input source impedance, such as a solar panel, the input voltage regulation loop can prevent the input \nvoltage from being pulled too low in high output load conditions. For applications with a low input source \nimpedance, such as batteries, the VIN feedback loop can prevent the battery from being over-discharged. For \napplications with loads on the VIN supply, such as a DC back up system, the input voltage regulation loop can \nreduce the input current to negative area to reverse power conversion direction to discharge the backup battery \nor supper capacitor to supply a regulated VIN for the loads. The regulated input voltage value is determined by \nEquation 6.\nFB_IN is a dual-function pin. It also sets the phase angle of the clock output signal on the CLKOUT/DITHER \npin, shown in Table 2 on page 35. The VIN feedback loop is disabled when the FB_IN pin voltage is below 0.3V \nor above 4.7V. The VIN feedback loop is also disabled in DEM mode and during soft-start.\nFigure 42.

Functional Description\nmode period disappears and the load current further increases but still does not meet the Equation 12 exit condition, \nthe output voltage drops. When the FB_OUT pin voltage drops to 0.78V, the controller exits Burst mode and runs \nin normal DEM PWM mode. The voltage error amplifier takes control of the output voltage regulation. \nBecause the VOUT is controlled by a window comparator in Burst mode, higher than normal low frequency voltage \nripples appear on the VOUT, which can generate audible noise if the inductor and output capacitors are not chosen \nproperly. Also, the efficiency in D/(1-D) Buck-Boost mode is low. To avoid these drawbacks, the Burst mode can be \ndisabled by choosing a bigger RIMOUT to set the IMON_OUT pin voltage higher than 0.88V at no load condition, \nshown in Equation 13. The part runs in DEM mode only. Pulse Skipping mode can also be implemented to lower the \nlight load power loss with much lower output voltage ripple as the VOUT is always controlled by the regulator Gm1.\n5.8\nPrebiased Power-Up\nThe ISL81401 and ISL81401A have the ability to soft-start with a prebiased output by running in forced DEM \nmode during soft-start. The output voltage is not pulled down during prebiased start-up. PWM mode is not active \nuntil the soft-start ramp reaches 90% of the output voltage times the resistive divider ratio. Forced DEM mode is \nset again when the SS/TRK pin voltage is pulled to less than 0.3V by either internal or external circuit.\nThe overvoltage protection function is still alive during soft-start of the DEM operation. \n5.9\nFrequency Selection \nSwitching frequency selection is a trade-off between efficiency and component size. Low switching frequency \nimproves efficiency by reducing MOSFET switching loss. To meet the output ripple and load transient \nrequirements, operation at a low switching frequency would require larger inductance and output capacitance. The \nswitching frequency of the ISL81401 and ISL81401A is set by a resistor connected from the RT/SYNC pin to GND \naccording to Equation 1 on page 10.\nThe frequency setting curve shown in Figure 50 assists in selecting the correct value for RT.\n5.10\nPhase Lock Loop (PLL)\nThe ISL81401 and ISL81401A integrate a high performance PLL. The PLL ensures the wide range of accurate \nclock frequency and phase setting. It also easily synchronizes the internal clock to an external clock with the \nfrequency either lower or higher than the internal setting.\nAs shown in Figure 51, an external compensation network of RPLL, CPLL1, and CPLL2 is needed to connect to the \nPLL_COMP pin to ensure PLL stable operation. Renesas recommends choosing 2.7kΩ for RPLL, 10nF for CPLL1, \nand 820pF for CPLL2. With the recommended compensation network, the PLL stability is ensured in the full clock \nfrequency range of 100kHz to 600kHz.\nFigure 50.

When the RT/SYNC pin is connected to the CLKOUT/DITHER pin of another \nISL81401, the two controllers operate in cascade synchronization with phase interleaving.\nWhen the RT/SYNC pin is connected to an external clock, the ISL81401 and ISL81401A synchronizes to this \nexternal clock frequency. The frequency set by the RT resistor can be either lower or higher than, or equal to the \nexternal clock frequency.\nThe CLKOUT/DITHER pin outputs a clock signal with approximately 300ns pulse width. The signal frequency is \nthe same as the frequency set by the resistor from the RT pin to ground or the external sync clock. The signal rising \nedge phase angle to the rising edge of the internal clock or the external clock to the RT/SYNC pin can be set by the \nvoltage applied to the FB_IN and IMON_IN pins. The phase interleaving can be implemented by the cascade \nconnecting of the upper chip CLKOUT/DITHER pin to the lower chip RT/SYNC pin in a parallel system. Table 2 \nshows the CLKOUT/DITHER phase settings with different FB_IN and IMON_IN pin voltages.\nWhen FB_IN is connected to 4.5V, the VIN feedback control loop is disabled. When IMON_IN is connected to 4.5V, \nthe average input current control loop and input current hiccup OCP are disabled.\nIn multi-chip cascade parallel operation, the CLKOUT pin of the upstream chip is connected to the RT/SYNC pin of \nthe downstream chip. Renesas recommends leaving the RT/SYNC pin open for all the slave chips. The FB_IN, \nSS/TRK, COMP, FB_OUT, IMON_OUT, EN/UVLO, IMON_IN, and MODE pins of all the paralleled chips should \nbe tied together. Refer to ISL81601 datasheet for the current sharing approach in parallel operation.\nThe CLKOUT/DITHER pin provides a dual function option. When a capacitor CDITHER is connected on the \nCLKOUT/DITHER pin, the internal circuit disables the CLKOUT function and enables the DITHER function. \nWhen the CLKOUT/DITHER pin voltage is lower than 1.05V, a typical 8µA current source IDITHERSO charges the \ncapacitor on the pin. When the capacitor voltage is charged to more than 2.2V, a typical 10µA current source \nIDITHERSI discharges the capacitor on the pin. A sawtooth voltage waveform shown in Figure 52 is generated on \nthe CLKOUT/DITHER pin. The internal clock frequency is modulated by the sawtooth voltage on the \nCLKOUT/DITHER pin. The clock frequency dither range is set to typically ±15% of the frequency set by the \nresistor on the RT/SYNC pin.

Each driver pair consists of a gate control logic circuit, a low side driver, a level shifter, and a high \nside driver.\nThe ISL81401 and ISL81401A incorporate an adaptive dead time algorithm that optimizes operation with varying \nMOSFET conditions. This algorithm provides approximately 16ns dead time between the switching of the upper and \nlower MOSFETs. This dead time is adaptive and allows operation with different MOSFETs without having to \nexternally adjust the dead time using a resistor or capacitor. During turn-off of the lower MOSFET, the LGATE \nvoltage is monitored until it reaches a threshold of 1V, at which time the UGATE is released to rise. Adaptive dead \ntime circuitry monitors the upper MOSFET gate voltage during UGATE turn-off. When the upper MOSFET \ngate-to-source voltage drops below a threshold of 1V, the LGATE is allowed to rise. Renesas recommends not using a \nresistor between the driver outputs and the respective MOSFET gates, because it can interfere with the dead time \ncircuitry.\nThe low-side gate driver is supplied from VDD and provides a 3A peak sink and 2A peak source current. The \nhigh-side gate driver can also deliver the same currents as the low-side gate driver. Gate-drive voltage for the upper \nN-channel MOSFET is generated by a flying capacitor boot circuit. A boot capacitor connected from the BOOT \npin to the PHASE node provides power to the high-side MOSFET driver. As shown in Figure 53 on page 37, the \nboot capacitor is charged up to VDD by an external Schottky diode during low-side MOSFET on-time (phase node \nlow). To limit the peak current in the Schottky diode, an external resistor can be placed between the BOOT pin and \nthe boot capacitor. This small series resistor also damps any oscillations caused by the resonant tank of the parasitic \ninductances in the traces of the board and the FET’s input capacitance.\nFigure 52.

When the voltage drops to 3.9V at no switching condition, a \nminimum off-time pulse is issued to turn off the upper MOSFET and turn on the low-side MOSFET to refresh the \nbootstrap capacitor and maintain the upper driver bias voltage.\nTo optimize EMI performance or reduce phase node ringing, a small resistor can be placed between the BOOT pin \nto the positive terminal of the bootstrap capacitor.\n5.13\nPower-Good Indicator\nThe power-good pin can monitor the status of the output voltage. PGOOD is true (open drain) 1.1ms after the \nFB_OUT pin is within ±10% of the reference voltage.\nThere is no extra delay when the PGOOD pin is pulled low.\nFigure 53.

UVLO protection shuts down the ISL81401 and ISL81401A if the input \nvoltage drops below 3.2V. The controller is disabled when UVLO is asserted.

EXTBIAS can activate only after VCC5V reaches its POR rising threshold.\n6.3\nOvercurrent Protection (OCP)\n6.3.1\nInput and Output Average Overcurrent Protection\nAs described in “Input and Output Average Current Monitoring and Regulation Loops” on page 29, the \nISL81401 and ISL81401A can regulate both input and output currents with close loop control. This provides a \nconstant current type of overcurrent protection for both input and output average current. It can be set to a \nhiccup type of protection by selecting a different value of the resistor connected between LG2/OC_MODE and \nGND.\nThe input and output constant or hiccup average OCP set points IINCC and IOUTCC can be calculated by \nEquations 9 and 10 in Input and Output Average Current Monitoring and Regulation Loops.\nThe average OCP mode is set by a resistor connected from the LG2/OC_MODE pin to ground during the \ninitiation stage before soft-start. During the initiation stage, the LG2/OC_MODE pin sources out a typical \n10µA current IMODELG2 to set the voltage on the pin. If the pin voltage is less than 0.3V, the OCP is set to \nConstant Current-mode. Otherwise, the OCP is set to hiccup mode.\nIn hiccup OCP mode, after the average current is higher than the set point for 32 consecutive switching cycles \nthe converter turns off for 50ms before a restart-up is issued.\n6.3.2\nFirst Level Pulse-by-Pulse Peak Current Limit\nAs shown in Figure 44 on page 29 in Input and Output Average Current Monitoring and Regulation Loops, the \ninductor peak current is sensed by the shunt resistor RS_IN and op amp A1.

Protection Circuits\n6.3.3\nSecond Level Hiccup Peak Current Protection\nTo avoid any false trip in peak current-mode operation, a minimum on or blanking time is set to the PWM \nsignal. The first level pulse-by-pulse current limit circuit cannot further reduce the PWM duty cycle in the \nminimum on-time. In output dead short conditions, especially at high VIN, the inductor current runs away with \nthe minimum on PWM duty. The ISL81401 and ISL81401A integrate a second level hiccup type of peak \ncurrent protection. When the voltage drop on RS_IN reaches the set point VOCSET-CS-HIC (typical 100mV), the \nconverter turns off by turning off all four switches Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 for 50ms before a restart is issued. The \nsecond level peak current protection set point IOCPP2 can be calculated by Equation 16.\n6.3.4\nPulse-by-Pulse Negative Peak Current Limit\nIn cases of reverse direction operation and OVP protection, the inductor current goes to negative. The negative \ncurrent is sensed by the shunt resistor RS_OUT and op amp A2 shown in Figure 44. When the voltage drop on \nRS_IN reaches the set point VOCSET-ISEN (typical -59mV), Q2 and Q4 are turned off and Q1 and Q3 are turned \non. The negative peak current limit set point IOCPPN can be calculated by Equation 17.\nThe device can be damaged in negative peak current limit conditions. In these conditions, the energy flows from \noutput to input. If the impedance of the input source or devices is not low enough, the VIN voltage increases. \nWhen VIN increases to higher than its maximum limit, the IC can be damaged. \n6.4\nOvervoltage Protection\nThe overvoltage set point is set at 114% of the nominal output voltage set by the feedback resistors. In the case of \nan overvoltage event, the IC attempts to bring the output voltage back into regulation by keeping Q1 and Q3 turned \noff and Q2 and Q4 turned on. If the OV condition continues, the inductor current goes negative to trip the negative \npeak current limit. The converter reverses direction to transfer energy from the output end to the input end. Input \nvoltage is pushed high if the input source impedance is not low enough. The IC may be damaged if the input \nvoltage goes to higher than its maximum limit. If the overvoltage condition is corrected and the output voltage \ndrops to the nominal voltage, the controller resumes work in normal PWM switching.\n6.5\nOver-Temperature Protection\nThe ISL81401 and ISL81401A incorporate an over-temperature protection circuit that shuts the IC down when a \ndie temperature of +160°C is reached. Normal operation resumes when the die temperature drops below +145°C \nthrough the initiation of a full soft-start cycle. During OTP shutdown, the IC consumes only 100µA current. When \nthe controller is disabled, thermal protection is inactive. This helps achieve a very low shutdown current of 5µA.\nIOCPP2\nVOCSET-CS-HIC\nRS_IN\n-------------------------------------------\n=\n(EQ. 16)\nIOCPPN\nVOCSET-ISEN\nRISEN\n-------------------------------------\n=\n(EQ. 17)\n",

Layout Guidelines\n7.\nLayout Guidelines\nCareful attention to layout requirements is necessary for successful implementation of ISL81401 and ISL81401A \nbased DC/DC converters. The ISL81401 and ISL81401A switch at a very high frequency, so the switching times are \nvery short. At these switching frequencies, even the shortest trace has significant impedance. Also, the peak gate drive \ncurrent rises significantly in an extremely short time. Transition speed of the current from one device to another causes \nvoltage spikes across the interconnecting impedances and parasitic circuit elements. These voltage spikes can degrade \nefficiency, generate EMI, and increase device voltage stress and ringing. Careful component selection and proper \nPrinted Circuit Board (PCB) layout minimize the magnitude of these voltage spikes.\nThe three sets of critical components in a DC/DC converter using the ISL81401 and ISL81401A are the following:\n• the controller\n• the switching power components\n• the small signal components\nThe switching power components are the most critical from a layout point of view because they switch a large amount \nof energy, which tends to generate a large amount of noise. The critical small signal components are those connected to \nsensitive nodes or those supplying critical bias currents. A multilayer PCB is recommended.\n7.1\nLayout Considerations\n(1)\nPlace the input capacitors, buck FETs, inductor, boost FETs, and output capacitor first. Isolate these power \ncomponents on dedicated areas of the board with their ground terminals adjacent to one another. Place the \ninput and output high frequency decoupling ceramic capacitors very close to the MOSFETs. \n(2)\nIf signal components and the IC are placed in a separate area to the power train, use full ground planes in the \ninternal layers with shared SGND and PGND to simplify the layout design. Otherwise, use separate ground \nplanes for the power ground and the small signal ground. Connect the SGND and PGND together close to the \nIC. DO NOT connect them together anywhere else.\n(3)\nKeep the loop formed by the input capacitor, the buck top FET, and the buck bottom FET as small as possible. \nKeep the loop formed by the output capacitor, the boost top FET, and the boost bottom FET as small as \npossible.\n(4)\nEnsure the current paths from the input capacitor to the buck FETs, the power inductor, the boost FETs, and \nthe output capacitor are as short as possible with maximum allowable trace widths.\n(5)\nPlace the PWM controller IC close to the lower FETs. The low side FETs gate drive connections should be \nshort and wide. Place the IC over a quiet ground area. Avoid switching ground loop currents in this area.\n(6)\nPlace the VDD bypass capacitor very close to the VDD pin of the IC and connect its ground end to the PGND \npin. Connect the PGND pin to the ground plane by a via. Do not directly connect the PGND pin to the SGND \nEPAD.\n(7)\nPlace the gate drive components (BOOT diodes and BOOT capacitors) together near the controller IC.\n(8)\nPlace the output capacitors as close to the load as possible. Use short, wide copper regions to connect output \ncapacitors to load to avoid inductance and resistances.\n(9)\nUse copper filled polygons or wide short traces to connect the junction of the buck or boost upper FET, buck \nor boost lower FET, and output inductor. Also keep the buck and boost PHASE nodes connection to the IC \nshort. DO NOT oversize the copper islands for the PHASE nodes. Because the phase nodes are subjected to \nvery high dv/dt voltages, the stray capacitor formed between these islands and the surrounding circuitry tends \nto couple switching noise. \n(10) Route all high speed switching nodes away from the control circuitry.\n(11) Create a separate small analog ground plane near the IC. Connect the SGND pin to this plane. All small signal \ngrounding paths including feedback resistors, current monitoring resistors and capacitors, soft-starting \ncapacitors, loop compensation capacitors and resistors, and EN pull-down resistors should be connected to \nthis SGND plane.\n",

Choose the buck or boost \nMOSFETs based on their maximum operation voltage with sufficient margin for safe operation.\nThe MOSFETs’ power dissipation is based on conduction loss and switching loss. In Buck mode, the power loss \nof the buck upper and lower MOSFETs are calculated by Equations 18 and 19. The conduction losses are the main \nsource of power dissipation for the lower MOSFET. Only the upper MOSFET has significant switching losses, \nbecause the lower device turns on and off into near zero voltage. The equations assume linear voltage current \ntransitions and do not model power loss due to the reverse recovery of the lower MOSFET’s body diode.\nIn Boost mode, there is only conduction loss on the buck upper MOSFET calculated by Equation 20.\nIn Boost mode, the boost upper and lower MOSFETs power loss are calculated by Equations 21 and 22. The \nconduction losses are the main component of power dissipation for the upper MOSFET. Only the lower MOSFET \nhas significant switching losses, because the upper device turns on and off into near zero voltage. The equations \nassume linear voltage current transitions and do not model power loss due to the reverse recovery of the upper \nMOSFET’s body diode.\nIn Buck mode, the conduction loss exists on the boost upper MOSFET calculated by Equation 23.\nA large gate-charge increases the switching time, tSW, which increases the switching losses of the buck upper and \nboost lower MOSFETs.

Component Selection Guideline\n8.2\nInductor Selection\nThe inductor is selected to meet the output voltage ripple requirements. The inductor value determines the \nconverter’s ripple current, and the ripple voltage is a function of the ripple current and the output capacitor(s) ESR. \nThe ripple voltage expression is given in the capacitor selection section and the ripple current is approximated by \nEquation 24 for Buck mode and Equation 25 for Boost mode. \nThe ripple current ratio is usually 30% to 70% of the inductor average current at the full output load condition. \n8.3\nOutput Capacitor Selection\nIn general, select the output capacitors to meet the dynamic regulation requirements including ripple voltage and \nload transients. Selection of output capacitors is also dependent on the inductor, so some inductor analysis is \nrequired to select the output capacitors.\nOne of the parameters limiting the converter’s response to a load transient is the time required for the inductor \ncurrent to slew to its new level. The ISL81401 and ISL81401A provide either 0% or maximum duty cycle in \nresponse to a load transient. \nThe response time is the time interval required to slew the inductor current from an initial current value to the load \ncurrent level. During this interval, the difference between the inductor current and the transient current level must \nbe supplied by the output capacitor(s). Minimizing the response time can minimize the output capacitance required. \nAlso, if the load transient rise time is slower than the inductor response time, as in a hard drive or CD drive, it \nreduces the requirement on the output capacitor.\nThe minimum capacitor value required to provide the full, rising step, transient load current during the response \ntime of the inductor is shown in Equation 26 for Buck mode and Equation 27 for Boost mode:\nwhere COUT is the output capacitor(s) required, L is the inductor, ITRAN is the transient load current step, VIN is the \ninput voltage, VOUT is output voltage, and DVOUT is the drop in output voltage allowed during the load transient.\nHigh frequency capacitors initially supply the transient current and slow the load rate of change seen by the bulk \ncapacitors. The bulk filter capacitor values are generally determined by the Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) and \nvoltage rating requirements as well as actual capacitance requirements.\nIn Buck mode, the output voltage ripple is due to the inductor ripple current and the ESR of the output capacitors as \ndefined by Equation 28:\nwhere ILBuck is calculated in Equation 24.\nILBuck\nVIN\nVOUT\n–\n\nVOUT\n\n\nfSW\n\nL\nVIN\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n=\n(EQ. 24)\nILBoost\nVOUT\nVIN\n–\n\nVIN\n\n\nfSW\n\nL\nVOUT\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n=\n(EQ. 25)\nCOUTBuck\nL\nITRAN\n\n2\n2 VIN\nVOUT\n–\n\nDVOUT\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n=\n(EQ. 26)\nCOUTBoost\nL\nVOUT\n\nITRAN\n\n2\n2 VIN\n2\n\nDVOUT\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n=\n(EQ. 27)\nVRIPPLE\nILBuck ESR\n\n\n=\n(EQ. 28)\n",

The output voltage ripple is much higher as \ndefined by Equation 29:\nwhere ILBoost is calculated in Equation 25 on page 43.\nPlace high frequency decoupling capacitors as close to the power pins of the load as physically possible. Be careful \nnot to add inductance in the circuit board wiring that could cancel the usefulness of these low inductance \ncomponents. Consult with the manufacturer of the load circuitry for specific decoupling requirements. \nUse only specialized low-ESR capacitors intended for switching regulator applications for the bulk capacitors. In most \ncases, multiple small case electrolytic capacitors perform better than a single large case capacitor.\nThe stability requirement on the selection of the output capacitor is that the ESR zero (fZ) is between 2kHz and \n60kHz. The ESR zero can help increase phase margin of the control loop.\nThis requirement is shown in Equation 30:\nIn conclusion, the output capacitors must meet the following criteria: \n• They must have sufficient bulk capacitance to sustain the output voltage during a load transient while the output \ninductor current is slewing to the value of the load transient. \n• The ESR must be sufficiently low to meet the desired output voltage ripple due to the supplied ripple current. \n• The ESR zero should be placed in a large range to provide additional phase margin.\n8.4\nInput Capacitor Selection \nThe important parameters for the input capacitor(s) are the voltage rating and the RMS current rating. For reliable \noperation, select input capacitors with voltage and current ratings above the maximum input voltage and largest \nRMS current required by the circuit. The capacitor voltage rating should be at least 1.25 times greater than the \nmaximum input voltage and 1.5 times is a conservative guideline. In Buck mode the AC RMS input current varies \nwith the load giving in Equation 31:\nwhere DC is duty cycle.\nThe maximum RMS current supplied by the input capacitance occurs at VIN = 2 X VOUT, DC = 50% as shown in \nEquation 32:\nIn Boost mode, the input current is continuous. The RMS current supplied by the input capacitance is much \nsmaller.\nUse a mix of input bypass capacitors to control the voltage ripple across the MOSFETs. Use ceramic capacitors for \nthe high frequency decoupling and bulk capacitors to supply the RMS current. Small ceramic capacitors can be \nplaced very close to the MOSFETs to suppress the voltage induced in the parasitic circuit impedances. \nSolid tantalum capacitors can be used, but use caution with regard to the capacitor surge current rating.
