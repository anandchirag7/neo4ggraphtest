Leakage stays below 1 mA up to the rated peak reverse voltage (PRV) and rises to a few mA near 200 % of PRV. |\n| **Capacitance vs. reverse bias** | Figure 3: total junction capacitance falls from ≈150 pF at 0 V to ≈50 pF at 100 V reverse bias. |\n| **Forward‑current derating** | Figure 4: average forward current (I₍AV₎) is derated with temperature. At 25 °C the diode can carry 2 A continuously; the rating reduces linearly to ≈0.5 A at 125 °C. |\n| **Operating‑temperature derating** | Figure 5 (B240 example): allowable reverse voltage is reduced as ambient temperature rises. For example, at 100 °C the maximum reverse voltage is ~80 % of the room‑temperature rating. |\n| **Surge‑current capability** | Figure 6: non‑repetitive peak forward surge current (Iₚₑₐₖ) versus number of 60 Hz cycles.

B220‑A to B260‑A Series (DS13004 Rev. 22, July 2015)**  \n\n- **Device family:** B220‑A, B240‑A, B260‑A rectifier diodes.  \n- **Electrical characteristics:**  \n  - *Forward I‑V:* Typical curve shows smooth rise of forward current from 0 A to 1 A as forward voltage goes from ≈0.2 V to 1.0 V.  \n  - *Reverse I‑V:* Reverse leakage current increases with reverse voltage; at 100 % of rated peak reverse voltage the leakage is on the order of tens of mA.  \n  - *Capacitance:* Total junction capacitance falls from ~100 pF at 0 V reverse bias to ~10 pF at 1 kV reverse bias.  \n- **Derating curves:**  \n  - *Forward‑current derating* vs. terminal temperature (‑40 °C to +150 °C) shows linear reduction; at 125 °C the allowable average forward current is roughly half the rated value.  \n  - *Operating‑temperature derating* for a given DC reverse voltage (typical 240 V) provides allowable ambient temperature limits; higher reverse voltages shift the curve left, reducing max ambient temperature.  \n- **Surge rating:** Maximum non‑repetitive peak forward surge current is plotted versus number of 60 Hz cycles; a single 10 ms surge of ~12 A is permitted.  \n- **Mechanical note:** Devices are intended for mounting on FR‑4 printed‑circuit boards using the minimum recommended pad layout (available on Diodes.com).  \n\nThese figures and curves are intended for designers to select appropriate operating points, ensure proper thermal management, and comply with surge‑current limits when using the B220‑A to B260‑A diode series."
